## Building the program


> ### In order to build, you need to have one of the required toolchains installed on your system:
- MSVC (Microsft Visual C++) toolchain
- MinGW-w64 toolchain

If you'd like to use MSVC toolchain, run this command before building:
>
```
 rustup default stable-msvc
```
>

Once ready, run `cargo build`
